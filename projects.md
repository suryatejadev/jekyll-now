1. [**Segmentation Framework**](https://suryatejadev.github.io/framework_segmentation/)  
[code](https://github.com/suryatejadev/framework_classification)
In this project, I developed a framework for semantic segmentation tasks. It includes Keras implementations of UNet, Dilated Unet, Dilated Densenet, etc.
