I am presently a 2nd year Master's student in the Computer Science department at UMass Amherst. I am primarily interested in the areas of deep learning, computer vision, natural laanguage processing and reinforcement learning. 

Previously, I graduated from IIT Hyderabad with a B.Tech (Honors) degree in Electrical Engineering. During my final year, I worked in the Immersive Multimedia lab of Prof. Sowmya Jana on deep learing approaches for abnormality detection in retinal OCT images. 

during the summer of 2018, I worked as a Computer Vision intern in the X-Ray division of GE Healthcare at Waukesha, Wisconsin under the guidance of [Gireesha Rao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gireesha-rao-05831a2).  

I will be graduating in May 2019, and I am presently looking for full time opportunities for that time. If there is a fit, do reach me out at [suryatejadev@cs.umass.edu](mailto:suryatejadev@cs.umass.edu). 

Please find my resume here and my CV here.  

Some of my recent papers are listed here.
