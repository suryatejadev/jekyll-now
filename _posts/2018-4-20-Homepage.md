I am curently a 2nd year Master's student in the Computer Science department at UMass Amherst. I am primarily interested in the areas of deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing and reinforcement learning.  

I graduated from IIT Hyderabad in the Fall of 2017 with a B.Tech (Honors) degree in Electrical Engineering. During my final year, I worked in the Immersive Multimedia lab of Prof. Sowmya Jana on deep learing approaches for abnormality detection in retinal OCT images. 

I spent the summer of 2018 in the X-Ray division of GE Healthcare as a machine learning intern. Here, I worked on several computer vision applications in X-Ray under the guidance of [Gireesha Rao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gireesha-rao-05831a2).  

I will be graduating in May 2019, and I am looking for full time opportunities. Do reach me out at [suryatejadev@cs.umass.edu](mailto:suryatejadev@cs.umass.edu).
