I am currently worknig as a Deep Learning Research Engineer at [Enlitic](https://www.enlitic.com/), where I am primarily working on deep learning applications of computer vision in radiology. My primary areas of interest are computer vision, explainable AI, and healthcare AI.

Previously, I graduated from UMass Amherst (Spring 2019) with an M.S. degree in Computer Science, and IIT Hyderabad (Fall 2017) with a B.Tech (Honors) degree in Electrical Engineering.

I spent the summer of 2018 in the X-Ray division of GE Healthcare as a machine learning intern. Here, I worked on several computer vision applications in X-Ray under [Gireesha Rao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gireesha-rao-05831a2).
