title: Welcome to my website!

I am interested in solving real life problems using machine learning and deep learning techniques, especially in the areas of data science in health care, computer vision and the internet of things. I have been working on several projects for the past two years to develop my skills in the same.
I am also a tech enthusiast, constantly trying to keep myself updated with the developments in technology, which is one of the primary factors that developed my interest in data science.
In my leisure time, I enjoy reading fictional and non-fictional books, browsing through sites like KD Nuggets, Medium, Quora etc.
